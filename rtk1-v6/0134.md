commen: "* As a primitive, this character adds to the meaning of <i>stream</i> the more vivid image of a <i>flood</i>. Note, however, that there are certain small changes in the writing of the element, depending on where it appears relative to other elements:
on the left, it is written the same.
on the top, it is written with the three strokes more like less-then signs
on the bottom, it is written with the third stroke similar to a fishhook"
