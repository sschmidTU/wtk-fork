commen: "* As a primitive, it can take three forms, to which we shall assign three distinct meanings.
In its kanji-form, it appears BENEATH or to the RIGHT of its relative primitive and means th physical organ of the <i>heart</i>.<br />
To the LEFT, it is abbreviated to three strokes, ⺖,  and means a wildly emotional <i>state of mind</i>.
And finally, at the very BOTTOM, it can take the form ⺗, in which case we give it the meaning of a <i>valentine</i>."

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro">radical_tyro</a>] 7-6-2006(9): When this primitive is on the left as <em>state of mind</em>, I had a hard time visualizing it. Thus I have created the following story. All the smartest people in the country were fed up with their state governments. These great <em>minds</em> joined together and created their own official <em>state</em>: the <em>state of Mind</em>. I visualize it as a small, sectioned off area with brains floating around. A scientific utopia.
