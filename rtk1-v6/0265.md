primit: "umbrella The actual character on which this primitive meaning umbrella is based we shall not meet until FRAME 1026 傘. We may think of it as a large and brightly-colored beach umbrella. If you compare this with FRAME 8 八, you will notice how the two strokes touch here, while the kanji for eight would leave a gaping leak in the top. [2]"

1) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LucidFaia">LucidFaia</a>] 9-4-2008(194): The two strokes at the bottom look like a J and I, which stands for &quot;jammed in.&quot;.

2) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alkulp">alkulp</a>] 29-10-2007(63): Two people<strong> jammed in</strong> under an <strong>umbrella</strong>. A woman with a dress and a man (straight). It&#039;s always me that ends up getting wet.... but the tail of the skirt is this time!

3) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yozora">Yozora</a>] 19-5-2009(55): J and I are &quot;Jammed Into&quot; an UMBRELLA.

4) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne">sethimayne</a>] 18-10-2007(13): The <em>beach umbrella</em> is<strong> jammed in</strong>to the sand using <em>two poles</em> instead of one, so it&#039;s extra steady. I was a little rough though so I accidentally bent one of them.

5) [<a href="http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok">romanrozhok</a>] 9-6-2008(12): 介する 【かいする】 (vs-s,vt) (1) (See を介して ) to use as an intermediary; to mediate; to assist; (2) to worry; to mind; to care. STORY: It&#039;s raining out and you are arguing with your bf/gf about why they didn&#039;t bring their own UMBRELLA. Now the two of you are<strong> JAMMED IN</strong> under one (J and I just how lucidfaia said). Then imagine another person who forgot their UMBRELLA JAMMES IN with you and offers to MEDIATE your argument in exchange for protection from the rain.
